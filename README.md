# ML-Linear-Regression-Home-Price-Prediction-Analysis-Project
This project aims to predict house prices using a dataset that includes features like the number of rooms, type of property, suburb, and more. We will implement linear regression as the primary model, followed by Ridge and Lasso regressions to handle potential overfitting or underfitting.
